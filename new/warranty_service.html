                                     <li>A leak that cannot be contained</li>
                                     <li>No hot water. Have you checked your circuit breaker for an electric water heater or your pilot light for a gas water heater.</li>
                                     <li>No water to your home.</li>
                                     <li>Complete sewer stoppage. (Note: if there are two or more toilets in your home and one is stopped up and the other works, this is not an emergency.)</li>
                                   </ul>
                                 </div>
                                 <h3>Regular Warranty Maintenance Services</h3>
                                 <p>Listed below you&rsquo;ll find the conditions under which Gibson Plumbing will service and maintain our work. This service warranty is intended to be general in nature and to cover all of our existing projects. Not all of the items listed below may pertain to your particular project or job.</p>
                                 <h3>Fixtures and Trim</h3>
                                 <ul class="client regular" style="width:100%">
                                   <li>Fixtures and faucets should be checked carefully at the time of walk-through for defects or damage. Chips that appear after move-in are not included in this warranty unless they are the result of material flaws or due to poor workmanship.</li>
                                   <li>All fixtures are warranted for up to 1 year, unless damaged by the occupants. Normal wear and tear and routine maintenance are not covered.</li>
                                   <li>All damaged or defective fixtures are subject to inspection by the manufacturer's representative before replacement.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Faucet Dripping</h3>
                                 <p>Faucet dripping will be serviced for the first 90 days after occupancy. Servicing required beyond the 90 days will be considered routine maintenance.</p>
                                 <h3>Aerators and Shower Heads</h3>
                                 <p>To help conserve water and meet federal energy requirements, the aerators and showerheads installed in your new home are designed to limit flow. As a result, small particles of dirt, sand, etc. that pass through the water system may tend to clog the aerators. If water flow becomes severely restricted, simply unscrew the aerator from the end of the spout and flush out the remaining particles.</p>
                                 <h3>Drain Stoppages</h3>
                                 <ul class="client regular" style="width:100%">
                                   <li>Drain stoppages for individual fixtures such as toilets, lavatories, sinks, garbage disposals, washing machines, bathtubs, or showers will be serviced for a period of 90 days after occupancy. This allows enough time for a drain stoppage problem to develop due to construction debris.</li>
                                   <li>Drain stoppages caused by misuse will not be covered and will be charged to the homeowner at our standard service rates.&gt;</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Water Closets</h3>
                                 <ul class="client regular" style="width:100%">
                                   <li>The water closets installed in your home are a low-flush water-saving type, in accordance with federal law. You may not get as thorough a flush with a water-saving toilet as you did with a standard type. This is not a defect: it is the nature of all water-saving toilets. Tampons, sanitary napkins, paper towels, wet-naps, Q-tips, etc. should never be disposed of in the toilet.</li>
                                   <li>Water closets that are removed and reinstalled by others for flooring or other reasons are void of warranty unless Gibson Plumbing reinstalls them.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Toilet Adjustments</h3>
                                 <ul class="client regular" style="width:100%">
                                   <li>We warrant for 1 year. It is recommended that homeowners do not try to make repairs to their toilets in the first year as this may void the warranty.</li>
                                   <li>From time to time your toilets may need minor adjustments. Unnecessary service calls may be avoided by homeowner attention.</li>
                                   <li>To raise or lower the water level in the tank, adjust the screw on top of the ballcock assembly. DO NOT attempt to bend the float rod.</li>
                                   <li>Some local water is particularly aggressive toward brass and/or neoprene toilet parts. If your toilet will not shut-off, check your flapper for wear or deterioration and replace as needed.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Garbage Disposals</h3>
                                 <ul class="client regular" style="width:100%">
                                   <li>Garbage disposals are not designed to grind bones, and they should never be placed into the disposal. Homeowners should also refrain from placing vegetable peelings that could become stuck to the inside of the drain lines. Stoppages due to the misuse of your garbage disposal are not covered by this warranty.</li>
                                   <li>Your disposal comes with a small allen-type wrench for unblocking. To unblock your disposal, insert the wrench into the opening on the bottom of the disposal and crank back and forth until the object is dislodged. If the disposal still does not operate, press the reset button underneath the bottom of the unit.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Water Heaters</h3>
                                 <ul class="client regular" style="width:100%">
                                   <li>The manufacturer warranties the water heater against tank leakage for a period of six (6) years, and electrical components for one (1) year. After the first year, the manufacturer's responsibility is for parts only, and the homeowner is responsible for the installation charge.</li>
                                   <li>For your protection, water heater thermostats are factory pre-set to 120 degrees F. If you feel it necessary, you can raise or lower the temperature by adjusting the thermostat yourself. Make sure all power is off to the water heater before removing any plates. Please do not ask us to raise the temperature of your hot water. Caution: Temperatures above 120 degrees greatly increase the possibility of scalding injuries.</li>
                                   <li>Should your water heater not produce any hot water, check your circuit breaker, as well as the reset button located on the upper thermostat, before calling for service.</li>
                                   <li>Because of today's low-flow faucets and showerheads, you may have to wait longer than usual for hot water to arrive at a particular fixture. This is normal operation and not a service issue.</li>
                                   <li>External rusting or corrosion of the tank jacket is cosmetic in nature and is not covered by this warranty.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Shut-Off Valves</h3>
                                 <ul class="client regular" style="width:100%">
                                   <li>The valve is located close to the meter outside your house. You should know where this is and be able to close it in the event of an emergency.</li>
                                   <li>(Does not apply if the house has a manabloc system) There are shut-off valves located below all toilets, lavatories and kitchen sinks. The icemaker and dishwasher shut-off valves are located under the kitchen sink.</li>
                                   <li>All hot water can be shut off by closing the valve located above the water heater.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Special Finishes and Caulking</h3>
                                 <ul class="client regular" style="width:100%">
                                   <li>Special finishes on faucets such as polished brass, antique brass, or colors do not have as hard a finish as chrome. Do not use abrasive cleaners, brushes, or chemicals on the finishes. Water left standing on special finish plumbing and trim will cause spotting and buildup on the finish and eventually could leave them pitted and tarnished.</li>
                                   <li>Caulking and grout have been installed at various locations throughout your plumbing system (i.e. base of toilet, edges of sinks and lavatories, tub spouts). This has been done to prevent moisture from getting past the caulked area. Caulking tends to dry out or crack over time. It is the homeowner's responsibility to periodically check the areas that have been caulked and to replace the caulking when necessary.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Requests for Service</h3>
                                 <p>Most builders ask that you contact their customer service department for all warranty requests. Requests are then promptly relayed to us for immediate attention.</p>
                                 <p>If your builder does not have a customer service contact, please call our service department. If you need customer or warranty service, call (210) 661-4000 during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, from 8:00 am to 4:30 pm. If you have a plumbing emergency outside of these hours, a message will prompt you to our emergency repair service.</p>
