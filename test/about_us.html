          <h2>Our Plumbing History</h2>
          <p>1954 - Upon returning from serving overseas in the military, William C. Gibson worked
          for several contractors in the San Antonio area, earning his Master Plumbers License.
          Working during the day on new sites, he spent his evenings estimating jobs, and in 1954
          Gibson Plumbing Company began with two trucks.</p>
          <p>&#160;</p>
          <p>1972 - Mr. Gibson was joined in the business by his son William A. "Billy" Gibson.
          Together they continued the growth of the company having earned the trust and respect of
          Home Builders and Home Owners not only in San Antonio, but nationwide. The Gibsons
          contributed their success to the basic values of quality workmanship, exceptional
          customer service and fair pricing. These values are still the basis of the company
          today.</p>
          <p>&#160;</p>
          <p>2003 - Preparing for retirement the Gibsons decided it was time to sell the company.
          In assisting the Gibsons in the sale, Barry Bankler became very familiar with the
          company, its history and its basis for success, and decided that he wanted to carry on
          the company's traditions, so he bought Gibson Plumbing.</p>
